🧊 Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster
🚢 Project Overview
This project is based on the famous Kaggle competition "Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster", where the goal is to build a predictive model to determine which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck.

Using the passenger data (like age, gender, ticket class), I trained and evaluated several machine learning models to predict survival outcomes.

🎯 Problem Statement
Predict whether a given passenger survived the Titanic disaster using features such as age, sex, class, and fare.

📦 Dataset
train.csv: Training data with passenger features and survival labels.
test.csv: Test data without survival labels (used for submission).
gender_submission.csv: A sample submission file.

🧹 Data Preprocessing
Handled missing values (Age, Embarked, Fare)
Converted categorical variables (Sex, Embarked) into numeric
Engineered new features:
Title (from name)
FamilySize (SibSp + Parch + 1)
IsAlone (binary flag)
Normalized/standardized numerical features (optional)

✅ Results
Achieved a cross-validation accuracy of ~XX%
Kaggle public leaderboard score: ~0.78+
Learned the importance of feature engineering and model tuning

💡 Key Learnings
Data preprocessing & feature creation are as important as the model itself
Ensemble models like Random Forest and XGBoost perform well on tabular data
Hyperparameter tuning (Random Search) can significantly improve performance
Kaggle is a great place to practice and learn from others

📌 Future Improvements
Try stacking multiple models
Add more domain-inspired features (like cabin section, ticket prefix)
Use SHAP for feature importance explanations
